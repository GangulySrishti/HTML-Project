Ricardo Brennand Institute
The Institute is a must-see museum in Recife, which houses a beautiful art gallery and one of 
the largest collections of medieval cold weapons in the world. More than 3,000 items are 
scattered throughout the structure, which was built along the lines of a medieval castle.
 
São José Market
São José Market is one of Recife’s 24 public markets and the oldest iron prefabricated 
building in Brazil, exported from Europe to Recife in the late 19th century. It was built in 
the same architectural style as the European markets from that time and inspired by the 
Grenelle market in Paris. It offers the best regional crafts, typical dishes, cordel 
literature (literally "string literature") brochures, and medicinal herbs.
 
Jaqueira Park
Jaqueira Park boasts a large green area and several hiking, biking, BMX and skating trails. 
Besides its beauty, which is due to various fruit and ornamental trees and several gardens 
designed by the landscaper Carlos Belani, many events are held in the park, which also houses 
the Baroque-style Chapel of Our Lady of Conception.
 
Tapioca in Alto da Sé - Olinda
The city of Olinda is 10 minutes away from Recife and offers many tour options as well. One 
of them is to visit Alto da Sé (the hills where the Sé church is located) and eat a delicious 
tapioca in one of the many local stands. Tapioca is a crepe-like pastry made of cassava, 
usually served with some type of filling such as cheese. It is very popular in the region.
